# MLView authored workflow renderer

This package renders model-authored `WorkflowDocument` artifacts in the VS Code
webview. It provides interactive layout, scope projection, source navigation,
finding inspection, refinement requests, and SVG/PNG export.

## Commands

```sh
npm run build
npm run check
npm test
```

The committed `dist/mlview.js` and `dist/mlview.css` assets are consumed by the
VS Code extension. The JavaScript bundle exposes this browser API:

```ts
window.MLView = {
  version: '0.1.0',
  mountWorkflow(root: HTMLElement, document: WorkflowDocument, bridge: HostBridge): WorkflowViewApp,
  normalizeWorkflow(document: WorkflowDocument): MLGraph,
  bridges: { vscode(): HostBridge }
}
```

`normalizeWorkflow` is exported for contract validation and tests. `MLGraph` is
the renderer's internal layout model; it is not an analyzer input or public
mount format.

The bundle has no network references. The host sends revised workflow documents
through the `workflow` message and receives source-navigation, export, saved
state, and `refineWorkflow` messages through the bridge.
