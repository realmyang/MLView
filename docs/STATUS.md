# Current status

MLView ships one workflow: invoke the native `mlview` skill in Copilot, Codex or
Claude Code, then open its `*.mlview.json` artifact in the VS Code extension.
The active model interprets source and authors the diagram. Python helpers
validate structure, workspace paths, hashes and exact citations; they do not
perform semantic analysis.

The old static analyzer and all of its runtime integrations were removed on
2026-09-18 at the user's request. There is no analyzer CLI, Python package,
static rule engine, MCP analysis server, static Copilot tool, pre-commit hook,
or analyzer GitHub action in the current tree.

The native path includes installed skill ZIPs, a Claude skill plugin, a
WorkflowDocument contract, source/notebook navigation, evidence and
counter-evidence, scope filters, refinement prompts and revision watching.
Malformed revisions retain the last valid diagram. No model runs on open,
refresh, filtering or source navigation.

This remains experimental. Recorded native development artifacts and review
ledgers are preserved, including their known shortcomings; human semantic review
and the held-out native-host pilot are still pending. Structural test results do
not establish model accuracy. See [the evaluation protocol](../evals/workflow/README.md)
and [current validation](VALIDATION.md).

Historical live host exercises predate this removal. Windows and remote VS Code
interaction need live validation before compatibility is claimed. The rewritten
CI matrix must run on this revision; old green runs are not evidence for it.
